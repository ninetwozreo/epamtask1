# Task 1

Requirements:
Please implement a method that can fetch and return the temperature of one certain county in China. Here are the specific features:
Feature 1: The method signature is `public Optional<Integer> getTemperature(String province, String city, String county)`.
Feature 2: If the location is invalid, return reasonable value.
Feature 3: Add reasonable retry mechanism, cause there might be connection exception when calling the weather API.
Feature 4: The method need block invocation if the TPS(transactions per second) is more than 100.

Here is the APIs flow that shows how to get the temperature of ‘苏州’：
Get the province code of China
http://www.weather.com.cn/data/city3jdata/china.html
Get the city code of one certain province
http://www.weather.com.cn/data/city3jdata/provshi/10119.html
‘10119’ is ‘province code’
Get the county code of one certain city
http://www.weather.com.cn/data/city3jdata/station/1011904.html
‘1011904’ is ‘province code + city code’
Get the weather of one certain county
http://www.weather.com.cn/data/sk/101190401.html
‘101190401’ is ‘province code + city code + county code.’

Accepted Criteria:
JDK 1.8+ Project (Stream API is required)
Build with Maven.
Cover all above function requirements.
Unit Test (Including both Boundary tests and Exception tests. Success with Junit Assertations.)
